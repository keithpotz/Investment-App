# Investment App
### Introduction
This is a basic C++ program that takes user input for Initial Investment Amount, Input for Monthly Deposit, Input for Annual percentage, and input for over how many years this investment will sit.
The program takes the user's input and then displays it in an easy to read way.


##What's to come?
Take user input and then output to a file that is saved. Eventually will extend code to be more visual and statically keep the information stored for easy access.
